# AndroidGuard-AndroidApp
A small anti-theft android application. It communicates with the [web app](https://github.com/micjabbour/AndroidGuard-WebApp) to send location updates, receive cloud messages...

The application was created while I was toying around with the Android framework (google play services location api, firebase cloud messaging, firebase job scheduler, ...) . It does not provide any guarantee or warranty of any kind, use at your own risk.
